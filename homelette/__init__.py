homelette
=========

homelette is an interface for various homology modelling tools, enabling the
user to easily assemble custom homology modelling pipelines.

Please check out the documentation and tutorials at
https://homelette.readthedocs.io/.

The docstring examples assume that `homelette` has been imported as `hm`. Code
snipets are indicated by three greater-than signs::

    >>> import homelette as hm

Use the build-in ``help`` function to view the docstring of a function or
class::

    >>> help(hm.Task)
